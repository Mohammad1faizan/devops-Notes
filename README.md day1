This project is built using modern DevOps practices to ensure continuous integration, continuous delivery, and seamless collaboration between development and operations teams. We leverage automated pipelines, monitoring, and best practices to enhance the quality and speed of development and deployment.

Key DevOps Practices Used
Continuous Integration (CI): Code is frequently integrated into a shared repository. Every change triggers an automated build and tests to ensure the integrity of the codebase.

Continuous Delivery (CD): The project supports continuous delivery, enabling automated deployment to staging or production environments after successful testing.

Automation: We automate the build, testing, and deployment processes to reduce human error and improve efficiency.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Infrastructure is defined and provisioned using code, making it scalable and repeatable across environments.

Monitoring and Feedback: We actively monitor the production environment to gather feedback and ensure that performance is consistent. Automated alerts help us resolve issues faster.
